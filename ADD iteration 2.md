### Step 1: Review inputs
| Category | Details |
| -------- | ------- |
| Design Purpose | This is a greenfield system from a mature domain. The purpose is to produce a sufficiently detailed design to support the construction of the system. |
| Primary Functional Requirements | UC-2: Fundamental function of the application <br> UC-3: Directly Supports core business |
| Quality Attributes | QA-1: Performance <br> QA-4 Usability |
### Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers
The goal of the first iteration is to design the overall architecture of the system. These will be use to build the basis of the design:
- CON-3: CMS will use a database to store and update information
- CON-6: Students will be able to access all necessary information.
- QA-4: Performance
### Step 3: Choose one or more element to design
### Step 4: Choose one or more design concepts
### Step 5: Instantiate Architectural Elements, Allocate Responsibilites, and Define Interfaces
### Step 6: Sketch Views and Record Deisgn Decisions
### Step 7: Perform analysis of current design and review interation goal and achiecement of design purpose.
