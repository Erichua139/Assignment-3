# Iteration 2: Identifying Structures to Support Primary Functionality 
### Step 1: Review inputs
| Category | Details |
| -------- | ------- |
| Design Purpose | This is a greenfield system from a mature domain. The purpose is to produce a sufficiently detailed design to support the construction of the system. |
| Primary Functional Requirements | UC-2: Fundamental function of the application <br> UC-3: Directly Supports core business |
| Quality Attributes | QA-1: Performance <br> QA-4 Usability |
### Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers
The goal of this iteration is to address the general architecture concern of identifying stucture to support primary functionality. The following are are the system's primary use cases.
- UC-2
- UC-3
### Step 3: Choose one or more element to design
For this iteration we will be refining the modules. The support of functionality in the system depends on the modules working together, so we are refining this aspect.
### Step 4: Choose one or more design concepts
### Step 5: Instantiate Architectural Elements, Allocate Responsibilites, and Define Interfaces
### Step 6: Sketch Views and Record Deisgn Decisions
### Step 7: Perform analysis of current design and review interation goal and achiecement of design purpose.
